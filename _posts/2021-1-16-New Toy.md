I've had an iPad for some time now. It's a fair tool for watching videos or
listening to podcasts on pocketcast. I've yet to figure out how to get music
onto it but I'm not sure I ever will. One feature I almost always need on every
mobile device is a calculator. Yes, I could use pencil and paper but this
device, any device, should minimally be able to calculate a tip or a loan
payment. Yes, it has a browser, no  that's google calculator isn't enough.

Some time back, I did find an HP-15C emulator. I like it. It's free, it looks
like the device that got me through undergrad but let's be honest - it's not a
a spreadsheet.

Then I found it. The best thing since sliced bread. Not python but a jupyter
notebook impelementation called Carnets. It runs a 3.9 Python with pandas and
numpy and matplotlib pre-installed. The keyboard's not great but it stores
your ```.ipynb``` files in a Carnets folder on your apple shared drive so you
could, if you wish, edit them on a more capable machine (with a keyboard, and
sure, you could have a keyboard on an iPad - I do not).
