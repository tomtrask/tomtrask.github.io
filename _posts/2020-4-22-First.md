Single Delta: "$$ \Delta $$"

This should be some LaTeX:

$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$

And the next bit should be some python context highlighting:

{% highlight python %}
def sample_urn(urn_contents, num_marbles_to_choose):
    """Sample marbles from an urn"""
    urn = functools.reduce(operator.iconcat, 
                           [count*[key] for key, count in urn_contents.items()],
                           [])
    random.shuffle(urn)

    # different way to do reservoir
    chosen_marbles = urn[:min(len(urn), num_marbles_to_choose)]
    if len(urn) > num_marbles_to_choose:
        for index, marble in enumerate(urn[num_marbles_to_choose:]):
            selector = random.randint(0, index+num_marbles_to_choose)
            if selector < num_marbles_to_choose:
                chosen_marbles[selector] = marble
    return Counter(chosen_marbles)
{% endhighlight %}

As long as that works, I can sort out the rest of this later.
