    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>
      I read about a thing called ABC, approximate bayesian computation. I saw
      a real life question that would succumb to this approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real life situation was this - one day, I'm driving to Costco, I see
      a fleet bus with new front signage. The sign said Cancer.org. I saw a
      similar bus along the same stretch of road the next day. Both buses were
      crimson. So I ask myself - is there a cancer.org symposium in town? Is
      this a shuttle between one meeting place and another? between hospitals?
      Fast forward to later that week or maybe the next, I see a bus when I'm
      driving with YT along that same stretch of road. I tell her I've seen the
      bus before. Or is it buses? Seems like I'm seeing a single bus far too
      frequently for chance.
    </p>
    <h4>Procedures</h4>
    <p>
      These are my initial assumptions about the buses:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There aren't many of these buses so I can model their appearance like a
        Poisson process.
      </li>
      <li>
        The buses are traveling between housing and work (even if work is a
        symposium and housing is hotels in the city - specious)
      </li>
      <li>
        the approximate path of the buses is from SF to Menlo Park (Stanford
        Hospital?) a total of about 20 miles.
      </li>
      <li>
        My observations have all been in one stretch of 101 near SFO, I'm
        calling that a window of about 1 mile in each of the NB and SB lanes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The buses only run on week days
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I started working on this on a Wednesday (maybe) and guessed that I'd seen
      about two weeks worth of data (probably a bit high, in retrospect). My
      net observations on any given day consist of the number of times I've seen
      one or two buses in the two windows I can see from the pedestrian bridge
      at Burlingame Avenue (substituting the observations further west/north for
      observations in those two windows). My "universe" these buses inhabit is
      broken down into 40 such windows. My generative model consists of
      scattering U(1,40) buses in those windows as many times as I have to to
      simulate the number of observations I have at any moment in time. For
      instance, on the first
      day I have (10, 3, 0) maybe, next day maybe (11,3,0) - in those cases
      I'd scatter buses 13 and 14 times respectively. The number of buses
      scattered that result in the observed distribution of sightings is added
      to our posterior distribution. Easy peasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote the original code,
      <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m81OxYndMbA3isPwJZXk_0tUirZj49-2#scrollTo=owKjtc2Db4rv">over here</a> before I made any concerted effort to gather more
      observations. When I did gather more information, I did my usual morning
      walk which, it turns out, is not nearly as predictable as it should be
      to call this anything like a rigorous investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original version of the code ran for a fixed number of runs, later I
      modified that to run until it had 2000 runs that matched the expected
      distribution.
    </p>
    <h4>Results</h4>
    <p>
      Using the first day data, (10, 4, 1), I get in one run with a 95% range
      of 4-15 buses and a mode of 9 buses (median 8). Running this multiple
      times I observed that the top and bottom of that 95% range vary by one
      most of the time (so maybe if you ran it again, you'd get 3-15, maybe
      4-14 but less frequently as high as 5-16.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I piled on more observations, the range went up. More observations
      increased the frequency of spotting two busses which didn't really fit my
      original hypothesis that the buses were operated on behalf of cancer.org.
      In fact, one day I saw two buses in the same window. That is, I saw my
      Poisson model break. On that day I stood on the Peninsula overpass and
      observed a series of four buses marked that way in a pack (fortunately
      that is not my observation window or I'd be screwed). When those buses
      passed the overpass I saw that they were operated by Loop and WeDriveU.
      Personally I know I've seen those buses around Mountain view and SF
      offices of Google. I don't know that they're all operated for Google's
      exclusive benefit but I'll presume that the operator advertises with
      those cancer.org and SupportPink slogans on the displays and the operator
      obtains some benefit for the charitable non-cash donation. This fits well
      with the fact that I didn't see any such bus before a recent date (the
      promotion might be new, maybe because of a cancer awareness month).
    </p>
    <p>
      The final distribution of observations is (12, 5, 2) as of this morning,
      2019-10-23. That suggests a 95% range of 6-16 buses, mode=9,
      median=10.
    </p>
    <h4>Conclusions</h4>
    <p>
      Obviously our initial model is off but I'm not sure how that affects our
      results. I mean, if our universe has 6 additional windows (i.e. is 23
      miles long instead of 20 miles) does that change the size of our 95%
      range? Ok, tried it, got a range of 5-18, mode 12, median 11. So wider
      ranges, higher median and mode. Kind of what we'd expect.
    </p>
    <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I got some good practical application of ABC.</li>
      <li>
        My appilcation wasn't just a rewrite of the basic version I read in
        whatever book I first learned about ABC in.
      <li>
        I got to play with google colab...I don't know that it's faster than
        my laptop but I did read somewhere that it has access to tenforflow
        hardware so I'll definitely use it for that.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What's Missing?</h4>
    <p>
      I'd like to not depend on the length of the highway for
      my estimates. I think I could get around that by picking a spot and simply
      counting the number of vehicles that pass that point in a fixed timespan
      on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <h4>What's Next?</h4>
    <p>
      There are better techniques than ABC, Stan seems to be a toolset to
      explore some of those options and that's certainly where I'm going next.
      If I need a better data set I might expand my bus observations or better
      still use some of the MLB or NBA game data I've gathered.
    </p>
    <h4>Duh!</h4>
    <p>
      There's always something that I wasn't looking for, per se, that I
      overlook when I'm writing up my conclusions and summary. Namely, in this
      case I know that the Cancer.org/SupportPink buses are very likely Google
      livery (and I get that from the WeDriveU and Loop ownership more than
      anything). It is noteworthy to me that the companies that have fleets
      tend to go out of their way to avoid labels. MPK buses are always bound
      for Facebook. The buses bound for Apple say "Wolfe Transit Center" in a
      small square sign by the door. And of course outbound buses may say
      anything. I think Google buses say SVL or MTV inbound. Some buses have
      taken to turning off all the signs while on the road (this seems wise).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me restate the final conclusion. I saw a bus with a new label -
      Cancer.org. I hypothesized that it was a new fleet operator. Two
      observations seem to argue against that hypothesis. One, the math says
      there are quite a few of those buses out there. There are more buses than
      my hypothesis can really explain. And two, I saw the name of the shuttle
      operator on some of the buses with that label. I don't have numbers to
      tell me how many buses WeDriveU or Loop contract to other organizations
      besides Google. If we had that number we could better estimate the
      probability that there is, in fact, a new, possibly temporary, fleet that
      goes under the label Cancer.org.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, that's all I had. Thanks for reading.
    </p>
    <h4>Postlog</h4>
    <p>
      Saw a Cancer.org, WeDriveU bus exit SB 101 at Marsh Road today
      (2019-10-24). This exit is convenient for Facebook. This fits with the
      hypothesis that WeDriveU is independent of Google. This also fits with a
      paucity of MPK bound buses lately.
