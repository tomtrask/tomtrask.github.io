This is a public facing site discussing whatever curiosity driven development
I'm working on today.

## Current Big Thing
When a gambling site says "the Yankees will win over the Twins by 6 runs to 4"
what does that mean about their predicted probability of the Yankees winning
that game? Sure, if they get 6 runs, and the Twins get 4, they are 100% likely
to be declared the victor. but how likely is the outcome 3 to 4 or 4 to 6 where
the Twins win? And how does that predicted probability of a win compare to
actual outcomes or market based probabilities? Am I missing out on something by
ignoring their advice or is their advice simply an inducement to get me to buy
their product? I suspect we all know the answers to that last question but I
want to scrape some data and do the math because that's what I like to do.

## Tech Stack
Much of what I'm doing these days uses a python3 stack with pandas to do the
analysis and graphs. In 2018 I was using a nodejs app to gather MLB data - that
has been converted to an equivalent python script. I have from time to time done
some exploratory work in R but anything of any long term value gets converted
to a python script or Jupyter notebook. Most database work these days is done
on mongodb.

## Source
I'm not including source for the web scrapers here because I'm not really
selling code, I'm selling answers to questions. I could be convinced to put the
notebooks up here, though. Databases are a different question altogether.
