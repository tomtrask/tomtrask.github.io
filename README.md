This is a public facing site discussing whatever curiosity driven development I'm working on today.

## Current Big Thing
When a gambling site says "the Yankees will win over the Twins by 6 runs to 4" what does that mean about
their predicted probability of the Yankees winning that game? Sure, if they get 6 runs, and the Twins get
4, they are 100% likely to be declared the victor. but how likely is the outcome 3 to 4 or 4 to 6 where
the Twins win? And how does that predicted probability of a win compare to actual outcomes or market
based probabilities? Am I missing out on something by ignoring their advice or is their advice simply
an inducement to get me to buy their product? I suspect we all know the answers to that last question
but I want to scrape some data and do the math because that's what I like to do.
