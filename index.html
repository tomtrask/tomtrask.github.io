    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      The website <a href="//oddshark.com">oddsshark.com</a> acts as a type of
      marketplace for several online sportsbooks. As an inducement to visit
      their site and bet at one of their clients, they gave predicted scores
      for each sporting event they cover. The projected scores are real numbers
      with a single decimal point precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of ways to turn those projections into
      P(win for team x) and that probability can be used to compute a rational
      bet for one team or the other in all contests for which the vig (spread
      between the payouts for either team in a contest) doesn't straddle that
      probability. It is commonly accepted belief that the market is the best
      estimate of the probability of a team winning. If the payout for a given
      match is -110/-110 (essentially even money in American odds) we expect
      the underlying probability of either team winning is 50%.
    </p>
    <p>
      This raises several questions in my mind:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Is the probability of a win significantly different from the market
          predicted probability of a win (market probability is simply the
          payout on offer from a sportsbook)
        </li>
        <li>
          If the projected probability is different, is it a better predictor
          of victory than the market probability?
        </li>
        <li>
          How can I even evaluate the performance of the market in predicting
          winners? Is the market determined probability <em>really</em> the best
          probability?
        </li>
        <li>
          If the predicted probability is better than the market, can we produce
          an equally good prediction? Are we as good as those professional
          handicappers?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      This ongoing project seeks to answer these questions by scraping relevant
      sources on a regular basis and backtesting the predictions. Specifically,
      I'm only looking at baseball (MLB) and basketball (NBA) - so I can say I'm
      covering b'ball without fear of ambiguity.
