    <h3>Organization</h3>
    <p>
      My original objective in undertaking this tests was simply to determine
      if some freely available information had or has any discernible value.
      At this point, about a month into my second MLB season, I'd have to say
      the answer is maybe, maybe not.

    <h3>How Gambling Works and How I Talk About It</h3>
    <p>
      Today, somewhere, some individual player or a team will face off against
      another player or team in a contest that has rules that prevent ties - one
      or the other player or team will win. Betting invariably occurs, I only
      concern myself with that gambling done through a bookmaker. Sides of this
      contest might have names like Alpha Anacondas or Bravo Berries but I'll
      stick with letter names - A and B. A bookmaker takes bets on A and B and
      with each bet offers odds for the payout that depend on the amount of
      money that bookmaker has taken in for either side of the contest. If
      bettors have put $100 on both sides, the next bet will get even money
      something approximating even money odds. Even money is 1:1 in math class
      but this bookmaker is, in fact, in it for the money so she will offer
      odds, or payout of 10:11 on both teams and call it even money. A payout
      of 10:11 means that if you bet $11, you could walk away with $21 if your
      side wins or $0 if they loose. There is an implied probability of a win
      that goes with those payouts. In the case of a 10:11 payout, the odds of
      either team winning are 11:10 or the probability is 11/21 or 52.3%.
      Whichever side wins, the bookmaker will pocket about $1 per $22 bet. This
      is called vigorish or vig but that word has a negative connotation like
      it's the bookmaker somehow cheating the bettors out of their proper
      winnings. In fact, it's simply the fee the bettor pays for operating an
      orderly market. The payouts a bookmaker offers should always result in
      the bookmaker having a neutral position on any contest. If a bookmaker is
      offering even money on A, even after 2/3 of the bets have been placed on
      A, then that bookmaker is offering a higher payout than the betting would
      support and they then have a long position on B. And that's fine...but
      it's not something we would know about and it's not something we would
      expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Payouts can be expressed in different "units" but all those units can be
      converted to an implied probability or probability and I want to label
      that probability as a price of a bet. In fact the odds offered by a
      bookmaker are the ask price for a contest. Independent of that valuation,
      I may have another probability of a side winning that is above or below
      that ask price. If my valuation is greater than the price, I can compute
      a bet, f_star, with this implementation of the the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly criterion
      </a>.
      <div class="code_block">
      <code>f_star = p * (b - 1) + 1</code><br>
      Where:<br>
      <code>p</code> = my valuation, or probability of win<br>
      <code>b</code> = payoff of a single dollar bet
      (<code>(1-price)/price</code>)<br>
      <code>f_star</code> = the fraction of some nominal bet one should wager
      on this side
      </div>
      Kelly criterion lets us tie up gambling in a nice neat economic package.
      Wagers are a simple, game-theoretical, proposition that my estimate of the
      value of a good (a win) exceeds the market price. The greater the
      disparity between price and valuation, the more I will demand (wager).
      The value that Kelly adds is simply to tell us how much of our stake to
      wager on a given game (much like asset allocation in securities). This
      isn't a perfect analogy though. It explains demand but not supply. From
      the sell-side, gambling is simply a matter of balancing demands for
      competitive commodity products. Too much demand for product A and the
      price of A will rise and B will decline. So from the bookmaker's side the
      better model would be that of a bank. If loan demand is high, savings
      rates will rise. If there's a surplus of savings over loan demand, savings
      rates will fall (and so will loan rates - loan rates will never be
      lower than savings rates).

    <h3>Seasonal Results</h3>
    <h4>2018 MLB</h4>
    <p>
      The 2018 MLB season was the first season I played with. By play I merely
      mean that I scraped game odds and results from oddsshark and made paper
      bets based on those values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorry, I shouldn't say scraped. I went out every morning about 9AM West
      Coast and copied all the values into a csv file. I also used an mlb public
      API to get game details and correlate those details back with the
      (manually) scraped betting details. It was this manual scraping that
      accounts for some holes in my database. Ultimately, I did get details for
      1901 games and bet on 1869 (98.3%) of those games. We bet both sides of
      four games so the total number of bets is 1873. Paper bets starting with
      a stake of $10,000 look like figure 1.

      What can we make of this? It appears that from day 1 to day 130 we didn't
      benefit from betting at all. The final 3 weeks of the season seem to be
      the one time where the predictions vary enough from the market pricing
      that we can capitalize on those predictions. The red line is an
      exponential curve fit to the actual stake and the right hand intercept is
      about $27465.
