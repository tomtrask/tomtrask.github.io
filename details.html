      My original objective in undertaking this tests was simply to determine
      if some freely available information had or has any discernible value.

      I come into this with a couple of predispositions. Namely I assume that
      all sporting events are Bernoulli trials. All information about who's
      playing, how they play, how each player generates points is captured in
      a single, necessarily imprecise number known as the probability of a win.
      [Being a software engineer I'm placing a lot of emphasis on tools and
      process. I'd like, if there is some value, to not have to go look at the
      site daily to make my bets. I'd like an e-mail or something that just says
      "bet these games this way"]
